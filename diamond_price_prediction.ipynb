    "For this tutorial, I will be using a very popular case study by Darden School of Business, published in Harvard Business. The case is regarding the story of two people who are going to be married in the future. The guy named Greg wanted to buy a ring to propose to a girl named Sarah. The problem is to find the ring Sarah will like, but after a suggestion from his close friend, Greg decides to buy a diamond stone instead so that Sarah can decide her choice. Greg then collects data of <b>6000 diamonds with their price and attributes like cut, color, shape, etc.</b>"
